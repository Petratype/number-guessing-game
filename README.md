# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This little Python game was one of my very first projects, created as an exercise to practice basic programming logic and user input.  
It’s a simple guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 10** and you try to guess it.

I renewed this repository to keep it clean and organized (the first upload had some extra files by mistake).

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the Python file in your terminal or any IDE:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py 
   ```

2. The computer will think of a number between 1 and 10.

3. Try to guess it!

- If your guess is too high or too low, you’ll lose 10 points.

- You start with 100 points, and your final score is shown when you win.

## 💡 Notes

This was one of my first small Python projects.

The goal was simply to learn how to use random function, handle user input and create a loop that ends when the correct condition is met. Just simple practice on python and also github, extra simple.
